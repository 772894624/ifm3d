## Changes between ifm3d 0.1.0 and 0.2.0

* Added software trigger support to O3X
* Added support for ifm Vision Assistant compatible import/export functions for
  O3X cameras
* Optimization to `ifm3d` cmd line tool when passed either `--help` or
  `version`. It will no longer try to connect to the device first, which makes
  this much more responsive and convenient for when no h/w is plugged in.

## This file has started tracking ifm3d at 0.1.0

* Initial (alpha) release
